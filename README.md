# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
Identifying and Writing Problem Statements Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: 
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Identify the most suitable research methods 

Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario. Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points Motivation.

## Output:
FitLife -UX Project Report & Prototype Overview This document summarizes the UX work for the FitLife Health Tracking App and explains the prototype (website) included with this submission.

Problem Statements:
Fitness enthusiasts need a way to easily track daily activities and progress because existing apps are either too complex or fragmented, which results in inconsistent usage and loss of motivation. Health-conscious users need a way to receive personalized workout and diet insights because current apps lack tailored recommendations, which results in poor engagement and low goal completion rates.

Research Methods & Justification Selected methods:

User Interviews: 

to discover motivations, routines, and blocker behaviors. - Surveys: to validate patterns and measure prevalence.

Usability Testing: 

to iterate on flows and prototypes for clarity and efficiency. Justification: Combining qualitative (interviews, usability testing) and quantitative (surveys) gives both depth and scale insights. Usability testing ensures the prototype is effective.
